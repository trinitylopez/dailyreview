            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born November 21st in 2000, this year of 2015 I will be turning 15. I was born in Clovis at the Clovis Community Hospital.
                Since I was in kindergarten I have always played soccer up to this day. There for I think I could say that soccer is my hobby. It’s something I like to do on my free time and it keeps my family together. I have never played on a soccer team in Clovis, I’ve only played a few games there and that’s mainly because I play on a team from Fresno as do I live in Fresno.
My family is not as close as they used to be because things have happened but we mostly all keep in touch.
My parents split up when I was in 5th grade and things are better without them arguing while I tried to sleep. Since we have done nothing really all together we never had family vacations. The only time we went on a vacation was for soccer, which doesn’t really even count. So, I could say my dream vacation is to go on one period. I would like to go to Puerto Rico because it’s very pretty form pictures that I’ve seen.

                <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                <p>My long term goal is to get a scholarship to a UC and play college ball. My short term goal is what I am going to do to get there. First I will have to get good grades, in order to do that I will study hard and get the extra help if I need it. My second long term goal is to repay my parents for the expenses they’ve spent on me. Therefore my short term is to get a job soon and play professional or sponsor so that I can make their life better while I do the same with mine.</p>
                <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
            <h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>My grades have never been the best and especially when I moved to Bullard High School for the first quarter of sophomore year I was failing chemistry honors. The start of second quarter I moved here, Patino High School. Instead of chem. I’m now in physiology, one science subject lower but if it helps me pass so be it. Math is probably my worst subject because I don’t find any interest in it but it’s a requirement for me to get where I want to be, so I really have to try harder in that class than any other classes I’m taking at Patino High School.</p>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                <p>My personal life isn’t really spoken of but I guess I will say a little about it. When I was in the 4th grade my parents split up and I was barely learning to cope with it all. I played soccer when I was smaller and I still did at the time but I didn’t join travel ball until the 5th grade. I realized that was one of the ways to keep my parents could be involved with me together instead of just arguing. At the moment, my sophomore year is complicated. Soccer is getting more serious, my dad works out of town so I hardly see him. Lastly, my mom and I are trying to keep him involved with my life through Puerto Rico, Arizona, etc.</p>
